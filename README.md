# SOLID Principles in Practice

This repository contains **five individual projects**, each dedicated to demonstrating one of the **SOLID principles** in object-oriented design:

- **S** ‚Äì Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O** ‚Äì Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L** ‚Äì Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I** ‚Äì Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D** ‚Äì Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Each project showcases a **"Before and After"** approach:
- **Before**: Code that violates the respective SOLID principle.
- **After**: Refactored version applying the principle properly.

---

## Getting Started

Each project is organized in a **single folder** (e.g., `S-SRP/`, `O-OCP/`, etc.), and follows this approach:

- The **initial commit** represents the project **before** applying the respective SOLID principle (i.e., it contains code that **violates** the principle).
- The **second commit** (and possibly subsequent ones) includes the refactored version that **applies** the principle correctly.

This allows you to explore the evolution of the code by reviewing the commit history:

```bash
git log -- <folder-name>
```
